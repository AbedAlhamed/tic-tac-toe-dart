 Player X starts
 Each player selects the number of the square where they want to place their mark.
 Then, the turn switches to player O, who also selects a square to place their symbol.
 If a player chooses a number not between 1 and 9, they will be warned.
 If a player selects a square that has already been chosen, it's invalid and they will be notified.
 When the game ends, the players will be asked whether they want to play again or not.
